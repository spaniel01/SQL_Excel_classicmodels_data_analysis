# Description/ Scenario
A company client, a toy model company, has not made any in-depth analysis of its own internal data and would like to know how to improve its operations, cut costs and explore new business opportunities.  

Given the broad nature of these questions, this analysis is preliminary and for internal use only. It aims primarily to provide some initial insights into the data and to uncover avenues for further analysis. In this sense, some preliminary recommendations are formulated as well.

## Data and tools 
- Data was extracted from a sample SQL database called classicmodels from the [mysqltutorial website](https://www.mysqltutorial.org/mysql-sample-database.aspx). The code can be found in the sql file above.
- Subsequent data analysis was conducted in Excel. The major purpose of this exercise was to practice the use of Excel for data analysis. The Excel file can be found above.
